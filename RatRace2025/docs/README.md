# RatRace2025 Documentation Index

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-15

This is the master index for RatRace2025 project documentation. Documents are grouped by category for easy navigation.

## ðŸŽ‰ MVP Framework Integration Complete

RatRace2025 has been successfully integrated with the MVP backplane framework as a full-stack subproject. This includes:

- **Backend Integration**: Domain-driven financial modeling with event-driven simulation engine
- **Client Integration**: React/TypeScript UI using MVP `TabbedInterface` and message passing
- **API Contracts**: Standardized message schemas with namespace isolation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and BDD tests
- **Documentation**: Architecture reflecting current domain-driven design

See the [subproject-integration-guide.md](guidelines/subproject-integration-guide.md) for setup instructions.

## Navigation Tips
- Start with [overview.md](overview.md) for a non-technical introduction.
- For developers, begin with [subproject-integration-guide.md](guidelines/subproject-integration-guide.md) and [architecture.md](design/architecture.md).
- All documents include "See Also" sections linking to related files.
- Diagrams are in PlantUML format and render on GitHub or with compatible viewers.
