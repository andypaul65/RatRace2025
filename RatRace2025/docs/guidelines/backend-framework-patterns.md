### Modular Components
- Design patterns like Factory or Builder for creating extensible objects (e.g., EntityFactory for financial entities).
- Use Observer pattern for hooks (e.g., Spring's ApplicationEvents for event triggers).

### Extension Mechanisms
- **Hooks**: Provide callback interfaces (e.g., `SimulationHook` in services) for custom logic.
- **Abstractions**: Abstract base classes with overridable methods, documented with examples.

### Debugging and Support Integration
- **Backend**: Embed logging with SLF4J. Configure Actuator in `application.properties` (e.g., `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`). Recommend using IntelliJ's debugger for breakpoints in services.
