### Modular Components
- Design patterns like Factory or Builder for creating extensible objects in subprojects.
- Use Observer pattern for hooks (e.g., event emitters in React, Spring's ApplicationEvents), integrating with MVP backplane's registries.

### Extension Mechanisms
- **Hooks**: Leverage MVP backplane's callback interfaces (e.g., `OnInitHook` in client components) for custom logic, including theme application. For UX enhancements, override style hooks to extend cyberpunk styling (dark gray/black/green palette) while maintaining backplane compatibility. Document with examples for seamless integration.
- **Abstractions**: Extend MVP's abstract base classes with overridable methods, ensuring subproject logic aligns with backplane contracts.

### Debugging and Support Integration
- **Client**: Embed React Error Boundaries with custom logging, integrating with MVP's DevTools support.
- **Server**: Configure Actuator in `application.properties` (e.g., `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`), complementing MVP's debugging hooks. Use Spring Boot DevTools for auto-reloads during subproject debugging in IntelliJ.
